<h3>Fruition üçç</h3>

During my brief, attempted stint with music production, I found myself frequently desiring a digital hub of tutorials in fields like recording, mixing, mastering - all the essential skills in a modern audio engineer's toolkit. In preparation for building such a hypothetical hub for GA's WDI Project II, I asked many of my professional/aspiring musicians what they'd look for in such a service.

It turns out, not too much - while many of the musicians I spoke with would be interested in a service providing surefire tutorials accross the audio stack, most of them would be unlikely to register with the service if it didn't provide tools to help them get gigs. All this is to say, the networky, "LinkedIn-ish" side of Fullstaff sprouted from this concern.

<h3>What's there?</h3>

- Users can create accounts, "upload" lessons (post via embed link), comment and "upvote" lessons, and edit their displayed profiles to a small extent. There is basically search functionality through the optional "tags" uploaders may attach to their videos - one can click on tags displayed in the "tag cloud" (left side of main video page) to view only videos containing a particular tag

<h3>What's next?</h3>

- Actual search, options to organize videos by upvotes,  and, most importantly, far more options for editing one's profile - I'd really like to build out the social  element of an educational service like this. Much distance between the state of Fullstaff at writing and where I hope to see it grow; for now, we have a gloriously almost-not-broken foundation!
